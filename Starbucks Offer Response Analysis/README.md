## Installation
The Jupyter Notebook in the repository should be able to work without any issue using Python version 3.. with following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
The requirements.txt can be used to set up the environment.
## Project Motivation
Starbucks sends out offers to customers through various media channels to encourage buying. The offers can be discount coupons or  merely advertisements for specific drinks. However, only a proportion of the sent-out offers are viewed and used by the customers before expiration. 

To explore a smarter way to send out offers that gains a higher response rate, a simulation is conducted to mimic customer behavior on the Starbucks offers. The objective is of this project is to analyze the how the demographic characteristics of a customer, as well as the features of the received offer, may affect the way that they react to the offer.
## File Descriptions
The structure of the project and the file descriptions are as follows.
- [data](data)
	- [portfolio.json](data/portfolio.json) : contains meta data about the offers (duration, type, rewards, etc.)
	- [profile.json](data/profile.json) : contains demographic data of the customers (age, gender, income, etc.)
	- [transcript.json](data/transcript.json) : contains all transactions the customers made, all offers that the customers received, viewed and completed.
- [img](img) : contains the visulization results
- [Analysis_of_Customer_Response_to_Starbucks_Offers.ipynb](Analysis_of_Customer_Response_to_Starbucks_Offers.ipynb) : the Jupyter Notebook that performs the analysis
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) : All  required libraries to run the code for this project
- [README.md](README.md)
## Results
The project conducts qualitative and quantitative analysis of the customer's response to BOGO, discount and informational offers. The main takeaways are
- BOGO and discount offers are likely to get more response/completion from customers with longer membership, customers with higher income, and older customer groups.Â 
- Informational offers tend to get more response/completion from customers with longer membership, customers with lower income, and younger customer groups.
- The marginal improvement of the amount spent at Starbucks promoted by the offers is higher for the customers with lower income.
